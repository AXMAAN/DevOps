```javascript
const myArray = [20, 30, 40];

console.log(myArray[3]);
```

The above code is invalid because it attempts to print the value at index 3, but there is no index 3 in this array!

Remember, arrays start their indexing at 0, so this array has the following index values:

```javascript
// Index         0   1    2
const myArray = [20, 30, 40];
```

And therefore, this is the correct way to write this program.

```javascript
const myArray = [20, 30, 40];

console.log(myArray[2]);
```
