The lesson 7 challenge is an HTML only challenge.

I have already written the CSS for you.  There are two folders in this folder:

1. challenge/
2. solution/

Both of them have 3 files:

1. `index.html`
2. `style.css`
3. `script.js`

In the `challenge/` folder, these 3 files are already linked up for you, and your goal is to complete the `index.html` and `script.js` files.

You can solve this challenge locally with VSCode and the Live Server extension (you'll have to do a bit of research on this), or you can solve it on Codepen.  Here are the Codepen starter and solution files:
