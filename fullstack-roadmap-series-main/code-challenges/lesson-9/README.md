Lesson 9 is all about responsive design.

To apply the lessons, the challenge for this lesson is to make our pricing card from the prior challenge "responsive".  We can do this in one of two ways:

1. Mobile-first
2. Desktop-first

As you learned in the lesson, the only difference between the two is which CSS we write first, and how we write our media queries.  Therefore, I have included two folders that contain both solutions.  You can also see each solution on Codepen:
