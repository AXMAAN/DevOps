If you want to see an example issue, [please refer to this one](https://github.com/zachgoll/fullstack-roadmap-series/issues/1).  While I will try to get to your question as quickly as possible, I am creating this series for free and therefore don't always have a ton of free time.  Thanks for your understanding!_
