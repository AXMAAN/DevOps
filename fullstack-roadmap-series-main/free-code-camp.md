## Welcome FreeCodeCamp!

As you'll see, the name of this repository is called "Fullstack Roadmap", but the video you're coming from is called "Frontend Web Development".  Don't worry, **you're in the right place!**

The video that was posted on FCC was the first half of this broader series and all of the code challenges in this repository are up-to-date.

I've put this README together as your "one-stop" document to reference for everything course-related.  Below, you'll find:

1. Links to all the challenges throughout the course
2. Additional resources for you to research on your own
