In this step, our goal is to link the CSS and JavaScript files. As well as making the HTML structure.

We need two different `div`

- One for Analog Clock
- One for Digital Clock

Analog Clock should have 3 `div` for the area in which hour, minute and the second hand will rotate. Then respectively they will have a `div` for the actual hand.

```html
<div class="analog-clock">
    <div class="hour">
        <div class="hr-hand"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="minute">
        <div class="hr-hand"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="second">
        <div class="hr-hand"></div>
    </div>
</div>
```

For the Digital Clock. we will need four `div` for hour value, minute value, second value and AM/PM value respectively.

> Note - please provide proper ids and classes as required.
