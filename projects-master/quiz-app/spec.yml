long-description: |
  Your challenge is to build out a Quiz App and get it look as close to the design as possible.
  
  This project focuses HTML, CSS & JS. Javascript is really important in this since it allows the app to be functional by validating the correct answer
  
  You can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
  
  Your users should be able to:
  
  - View Highscores
  
  - Start and Complete the quiz with the functional timer
  
  - When questions of the quiz are completed the score is set to the remaining seconds of the timer.
  
  - The score should be added the to high scores in local storage

  - The high scores should be sorted in descending order by score

  You can go through the `Readme.md` to see more details regarding the project and the assets folder to see the preview images of the project for desktop and mobile viewports.
