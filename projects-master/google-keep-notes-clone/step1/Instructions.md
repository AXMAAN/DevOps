In this step our aim is to create the basic React components and apply the already supplied `style.css` styling to them.

Since, we are using React we can leverage its power to divide our project into modular components. By analyzing the end web app, we can divide into the following parts:

1. Header with `<h1>`.
2. Form `<form>` with `<input>` and `<textarea>`for taking user input
3. Notes with a title `<h2>` and content `<p>` to be displayed.
4. Footer with copyright text `<p>`.

With our components ready, we can now analyze the `style.css` file to add styles to our components. The styles can be added with correct selection of class names. (Note: **React** components uses `className` instead of `class` like in semantic **HTML**)

Now that we built the basic components and linked the `style.css` file with our components, let's move on to the next step and add user interactivity.
