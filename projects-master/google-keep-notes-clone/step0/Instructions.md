Hi welcome to your first step of Google Keep Notes Clone Tutorial. In this project we are going to build a working clone of the popular Google Keep Notes Web App using React.

In this tutorial we mainly focus on the React aspect of the project and hence you are already provided with required CSS styling.

Go through the `README.md` file to get a better idea of the project. You can view the final design of the project in the `design` folder. It contains the screenshots of the final output in desktop and mobile viewports.

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Build a React Frontend replicating the Google Keep Notes look.
2. Ensure that the web app accepts user notes and adds them to the list of notes.
3. User should also have the option to delete the notes taken.

Now that you have understood the basic requirements, hop on to the next step and start building the it!
