Now that we have completed all the functionality, let's add some finishing touches. We will use Material UI to add extra icons and effects for our project.

1. Adding Icons using MUI is very easy. Just import the required icon as a component, render that component where you require it to be shown.

```Javascript
import HighlightIcon from "@material-ui/icons/Highlight";
/* Add below code to display the icon*/
<HighlightIcon />

```

2. Add Icons for the Logo, Add button and Delete buttons, you can choose icons to your liking. You can search for logos here: https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/
3. Now, we will enhance our UI by adding conditional rendering to `CreateArea` component. At first our user needs to be prompted to enter just enter the content of the note. When user clicks on the `CreateArea` element, we can prompt him to enter both Title and Content of the note.

That's it!
We have completed the project, make sure that everything is working fine. Mark all the steps as complete, and submit the project!
