short-description: Build a Google Keep Notes Clone using React.
long-description: |
  Your challenge is to build a clone of Google Keep Notes and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

  This project focuses mostly on Javascript and React. We will make use of basic React Hooks and Conditional Rendering. 

  You can use any tools you like to help you complete this project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

  Your users should be able to:

  - Add their Notes in the website.

  - See appropriate animation and styling while adding notes.

  - Delete their notes in the website.

  - Download the starter code and go through the README.md file.

  The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project. 

  Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
