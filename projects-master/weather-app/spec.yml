long-description: |
    Your challenge is to build out this Weather App and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

    Prerequisites:

    - You should have a basic understanding of HTML, its tags, their attributes and such.

    - A basic knowledge of CSS and Javascript is also required.

    This project focuses on various concepts:

    - ReactJS and two of its basic hooks, useState and useEffect.

    - Fetching data from an API (Free and open-sourced Open-Metro API, which doesn't require any API key).

    - Basic styling using Bootstrap and CSS.

    Your users should be able to:

    - View today's weather and 7 day forecast for given coordinates

    - View minimum and maximum temperature for each day

    The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project.

    Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
