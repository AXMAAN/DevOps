Hello and Welcome to **Weather App** guided tutorial!

In this step, we will focus on basic styling of the app, with the help of Bootstrap classes.

#### Please carry out the following steps:

1. Firstly make sure that you already have some bootstrap classes: `row`, `col-3`, `card`, `card-title`, `card-body` already used in the boilerplate code.
2. Please note that, in **JSX**, to use a class attribute, we need to use `className` instead of `class`.
3. Basic wrappers elements are usually `div` elements. Bootstrap provides `container` class for such wrappers. Add `container` class to the `div` element with `id="weather-app"`.
4. We also have two input fields, their labels and a button for Coordinates. Add `input-group` class to the `div` element with `id="coordinates"`, to wrap these inputs together into a _group_.
5. We do have two input fields for `Latitude` and `Longitude` and their respective labels. Add `input-group-text` class to both the `span` elements and `form-control` class to both the `input` elements. This will style the `labels` and `inputs` to appear like a neatly designed form.</>
6. Let us also style the **Auto-Detect** button. Add `btn` and `btn-warning` classes to the `button` element with text **Auto-Detect**. This will style the button to appear like a Bootstrap button. The _btn-warning_ is merely a particular color, it doesn't necessary mean a _warning_

Thus, we have successfully added some basic styling to our Weather App.
