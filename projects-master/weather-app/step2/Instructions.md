In this step, we will focus on coloring elements, with the help of Bootstrap classes.


### Please carry out the following steps:

1. Please note that, in **JSX**, to use a class attribute, we need to use `className` instead of `class`.
2. Now let us style the **Temparature Details** table. We will make the table to appear like a Bootstrap Table. Add `table` and `table-bordered` classes to the `table` element.
3. Let us also style the rows of the table. Add `table-dark` class to the `tr` element with `id="temperature"`. This will style the row to appear like a Bootstrap Dark Table Row. We will also style the **Min** and **Max** rows of the table. To do so, add `table-success` class to the `th` element with text **Min** and `table-danger` class to the `th` element with text **Max**. Again <i>table-success</i> and <i>table-danger</i> are simply colors.
4. Finally, let us also color the actual values of **Min** and **Max**. Add `text-success` class to the first `td` element and `text-danger` class to the second `td` element.
5. Let us also color the `card-title`. This will display the **Date** once we fetch in the data. Add `text-primary` class to the `div` element with `className="card-title"`.
6. Finally, let us color the `h5`. This will display the **Weather** once we fetch in the data. Add `text-info` class to the `h5` element.

Thus, we have successfully colored elements in our Weather App.
