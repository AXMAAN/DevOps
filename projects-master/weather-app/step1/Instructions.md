In this step, we will focus on adding Alignment, Margins and Padding, with the help of Bootstrap classes.

#### Please carry out the following steps:


1. Please note that, in **JSX**, to use a class attribute, we need to use `className` instead of `class`.
2. The overall app would look much better if things are _center-aligned_. Add `text-center` class to the `div` element with `id="weather-app"`.
3. The heading, inputs, and the table seems too bunched up together. Let us add some margin after the heading **Weather App** and also before and after the **Coordinate inputs group**. Add `mb-3` to the `h2` element having text **Weather App** and also to the `div` element with `id="coordinates"`.
4. The heading appears to be stuck right to the top. Same could be the case at the bottom if we had enough content. To add some gap between these edges and our content, lets add some _padding_. Add `p-4` class to the element with `id="weather-app"`.

Thus, we have successfully added Alignment, Margins and Padding to our Weather App.
