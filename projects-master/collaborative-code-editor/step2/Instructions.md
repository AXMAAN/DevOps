In this step, we will be working on the compiler screen UI.
You can Build the UI of the compiler screen as shown below.

## Here are a few pointers on how you can do it:
- For the code editor part, you are free to choose any node package. The recommended ones are react-ace-editor or codemirror.
- Make sure to allow the users to copy the room id by clicking on the copy room id button. Here's your [hint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39501289/in-reactjs-how-to-copy-text-to-clipboard) on how to implement this.
- For better UX, show a notification, alert or a toast claiming that the room ID was copied succesfully.
- You can use dummy connected users for implementing the list of connected users part now.
- Leave the “leave” button functionality for now.
