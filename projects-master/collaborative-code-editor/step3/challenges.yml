    - text: The user who creates a room, gets connected to the websocket. 
    - text: You should start a socket.io room on backend at this point with the room associated with the roomID (random generated room code).
    - text: Now when other users join this room, socket.io can be used to broadcast a common message to all the clients already in the room.
    - text: The list of connected users should now be updated in the frontend.
    - text: the changes in the content inside the code editor should sync with all the other users in the room.
