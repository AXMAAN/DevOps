short-description: Build a Todo App clone using the assets we provide and test your HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills 
long-description: |
  Your challenge is to build out a Todo App clone & get it looking as close to the design as possible.
  
  This project focuses on HTML & CSS & JS. Javascript is used for making the website functional.
  
  You can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
  
  Your users should be able to:
  
  - Add a Todo
  
  - Mark Todo as done (strike through)
  
  - Delete Todo
  
  - Additionally, you can also persist a users Todo in local storage so that his Todo's exist even after a page refresh.
  
  All the best
