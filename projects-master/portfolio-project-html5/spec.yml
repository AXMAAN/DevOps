short-description: A simple and minimal portfolio page for you built in HTML5 + CSS3. You will learn how to create a portfolio page with your social media icons and links.
long-description: |
  Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

  This project focuses mostly on HTML, CSS and layouts with CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS   included for changing the states of screen.

  You can use any tools you like to help you complete this project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

  Your users should be able to:

    - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

    - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

    - Download the starter code and go through the README.md file.

  The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project. The `style-guide.html` file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.

  Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
