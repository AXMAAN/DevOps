hello in the part of making the contact page rsponsive.

## the break point i used: 750px;

- this is the most easiest part.

- just remove the h1 with `display: none`.

- then if you remember we have wraped name and email field inside a div with class user-info and give it `display: flex` so now, we can simply give it `flex-direction: column` and this will make them in different lines.

- now set their and button field's `width: 100%`.

- and if you want you can set height of textarea like `height: 200px`.

- for me the arrow is okay if not on your side just adjust it.

- and that's it now it should look like this:
