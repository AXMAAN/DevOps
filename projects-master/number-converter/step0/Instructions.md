Hi, do you know how a computer actually works? Whatever you do in computer at very low
level your instructions are in Machine understandable form i.e, binary 0s and 1's. Because computer understand only 0s and 1s. `0 means low voltage` and `1 means high voltage`, and this is how all the things going on.

However in this tutorial we are going to make our own `Number Converter`, which can convert from any number system to any number system. Probably you learned `Number System` in your
school.

Go through the `README.md` file to get a better idea of the project. You can view the final design of the project in the design folder. It contains the screenshots of the final output in desktop viewport.
Since we are only focusing on the functionality of the `Converter` we should limit the designing part.

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Make sure all the functions are working properly that you will define.
2. You should have the input-output section to give the input and see the output.
3. You should define all the functions in `script.js` and `number_system.js` file.

Now that you have understood the basic requirements, hop on to the next step and start building the it!
