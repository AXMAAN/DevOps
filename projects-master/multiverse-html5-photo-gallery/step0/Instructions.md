Hello there, welcome to the first step of the HTML5 Photo Gallery tutorial. In this project, we are going to build a photo gallery using an existing set of images. You can find these images in the `assets` folder. We will be using only `HTML5` and `CSS3` to build this project.

Go through the `README.md` file to get a better idea of the project. You can view the final design of the project in the `design` folder. It contains the screenshots of the final output in desktop and mobile viewports.

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Build a small gallery using 12 pre-existing images.
2. Ensure that the images are responsive and occupy the whole width of the page across different viewports.
3. Add a footer stating the name of the Project.

Now that you have understood the basic requirements, hop on to the next step and start building the it!
