long-description: |
  There are many good ideas of projects used with the main purpose of learning a technology. A good side project is always one that isn't too complicated, but allows you to learn the basic syntax of the technologies used and a bit of how to structure an application with those technologies. A Pinterest Clone is a good example of that.
