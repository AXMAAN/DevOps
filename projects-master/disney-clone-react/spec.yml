long-description: |
  Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
  
  This project focuses on building the page in React.js alongside CSS. 
  
  Your users should be able to:
  
  - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
  
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

  The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project. The `style-guide.html` file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
  
  Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
