Hello there, welcome to the first step of the simple shopping website landing page tutorial. In this project, we are going to build a landing page using an existing set of images. You can find these images in the `images` folder. We will be using  `HTML5` , `CSS3` and `Javascript` to build this project.

You can view the final design of the project in the `design` folder. It contains the screenshots of the final output in desktop and mobile viewports.\

You can check out the live demo here : [Nike-Fy](https://saurav-singh-rauthan.github.io/shopping-site/)

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Build a landing page using the provided images.
2. Ensure that the page is responsive and occupy the whole width of the page across different viewports.
3. Add a Navbar stating the name of the Project.
4. Add a Footer for quick links and small description.

Now that you have understood the basic requirements, hop on to the next step and start building the project :D
