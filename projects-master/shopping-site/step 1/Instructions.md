So lets begin 👨‍💻
Follow these steps for the first milestone that is to create a navbar :

- Create a `<div>` element with the class `'navbar'`
  
- populate the navbar with logo/name, links to product account and orders (these are dummy just for
  showing) in the same `navbar` div

- add a `<div>` inside the above div for hamburger with class `'nav-switch'` , this will be used further in the js file for toggling the navbar

- add a `<div>` with class `backdrop` outside `navbar` div which will used as backdrop for our mobile sliding side-navbar

- now style the `navbar` div according to the design in `design` folder and give the `backdrop` div a full-screen width and height with black background and z-index more than 100
