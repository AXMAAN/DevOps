In this step you have to add the background image to the landing page 

The background image is located at `/assets/images/BackGround.png` 

You can make use of the background-image property of CSS to add the image, also make sure that the image spans across the entire viewport and the background image does not repeat. Here you can make use of the `background-repeat` and `background-size` property. 

Create a new div tag and add the Search Bar and make it look like `designs/Landing Page [Website].png`
