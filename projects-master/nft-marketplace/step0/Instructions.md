Hello there, welcome to the first step of making the NFT Marketplace Project. In this project, we are going to build an NFT Marketplace, where users can mint NFTs by paying some amount of Ethers. 

Here are some of the things that you need to know in order to continue further.

1. The images to be used as NFTs and their metadata are available under `src/assets/nfts`. These images and metadata should be stored into IPFS Network. Also, there is an image asset `question_mark.png` under `src/assets` folder, that will be used as a placeholder for the next NFT that will be minted. For UI reference, have a look at `readme.md` file of this project.

2. The basic ERC721 based Smart Contract is written for you and it is present under `contracts` folder. You need to complete the smart contract by making some functions that will help your DApp to perform essential functionalities. Also, a `deploy.js` file is also present under `scripts` folder, that will help you to deploy the contract on some blockchain.

3. A React App has been set up along with a Hardhat environment which will help us to communicate with the smart contract using our frontend. You need to modify the React App, so that it looks something similar to the UI Reference in `readme.md` file of this project. Also, the app should be able to authenticate with an Ethereum Wallet like Metamask and allow the user to make transaction using authenticated wallet.

This project is completely based on these three instructions. For more info about some instruction, please proceed to the next step, where everything is detailed out.
