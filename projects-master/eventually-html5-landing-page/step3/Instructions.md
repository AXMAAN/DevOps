In this step you have to make sure that the landing page is responsive across all major resolution breakpoints. 

The following are the common breakpoints used : 

    320px — 480px: Mobile devices

    481px — 768px: iPads, Tablets

    769px — 1024px: Small screens, laptops

    1025px — 1200px: Desktops, large screens

    1201px and more:  Extra large screens, TV

Take a look at the mobile design in the `/designs` folder and set the layout for the mobile media query such that the content is at the center of the screen.

You can adjust the resolution of the landing page using the dev tools to test out your page looks across different resolutions.
