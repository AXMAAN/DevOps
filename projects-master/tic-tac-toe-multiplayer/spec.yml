long-description: |
    Your challenge is to build out a Quiz App and get it to look as close to the design as possible.

    This project focuses on your React and CSS skills, but you can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

    In this project, you app should consist of 

    - Creating & Joining an existing room 

    - Setting a websocket between the two players

    - Calculating the winner of the game 

    - storing the score of the game in local storage

    You can go through the `Readme.md` to see more details regarding the project and the assets folder to see the preview images of the project for desktop and mobile viewports.
