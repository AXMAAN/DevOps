  - text: On game over, the popup should ask for retry. If yes, users can be taken to a new game page.
  - text: The board data can be synced with the server. This way, instead of client, server decides who is the winner which is more reliable.
  - text: Make sure to have validation checks via server (i.e. whose turn it is should also be decided by a server variable, and if some user tries to go forward with a turn, server can kick that user)
  - text: If a user disconnects in the middle of the game, server should broadcast appropriate message to the other user saying that the user has disconnected.
