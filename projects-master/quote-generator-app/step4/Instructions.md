## Bonus tips ðŸ˜‰


Now that you have implemented complete app with minimum functionality, Try to implement the features I suggest below so that you can make this simple app more dinamic and aslo stand-out from the crowd.

* Further steps
   * Our UI is kind of dark mode-ish. Try to create a light mode version and also add an icon to toggle between both themes
   * Add an icon within or outside `quote-box` which can be used to copy the quote that we generated dynamically.
   * Add media queries to stylesheet to make our app more responsive and also to target each device specifically based on breakpoints.
   * # ADVANCED TIP :-
             Create an icon or button using which user can share the quote generated to `twiter` directly from our app.
    * Dont restrict this app within codedamn's playground. Learn to deploy this project using Github-pages, Vercal or Netlify so that you can share this wonderful app you've made with rest of the world.

    Also send me the deployed app's URL if you implemented the features I've mentioned above [here](https://codedamn.com/user/subramanya11)
