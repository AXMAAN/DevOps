long-description: |
    Your challenge is to build out this Quote Generator App and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

    This project focuses mostly on CSS and Flexbox in general. There's a tiny bit of JS included for making API call using Fetch API and Manipulating DOM Content.

    You can use any tools (Tailwind CSS , Vite , Axios etc..) you like to help you complete this project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

    Your users should be able to:

    - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

    - Generate an Unique Quote on each request.

    - Download the starter code and go through the README.md file.

    The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project.

    Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
