Hello there, welcome to the first step of building the app . In this project, we are going to build an app that generates a Quote using an API. You can find the finished app [here](https://quote-gen-app-subramanyarao11.vercel.app/). We will be using only `HTML5` , `CSS3` & `JS` to build this project.

Go through the `README.md` file to get a better idea of the project. You can view the final design of the project in the `design` folder. It contains the screenshots of the final output in desktop and mobile viewports.

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Build a small app which generates a Quote on click.
2. Ensure that the app is responsive and occupy the whole width of the page across different viewports.


Now that you have understood the basic requirements, hop on to the next step and start building the it!
