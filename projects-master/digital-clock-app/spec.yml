long-description: |
  Your challenge is to design this page and integrate quotable api to get random quote and ipv6 with geo-location to get city name (Also can be done using HTML Geo-location API).

  This Project focuses on React, but you can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

  Your users should be able to:

  - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size 

  - Show user's current time, timezone and location.

  - Display random quote and a refresh button.

  - Setting different background and greeting message according to current time.

  - Get additional data related to date and time on click of view more.

  You can go through the `Readme.md` to see more details regarding the project, the design folder to see the preview images and asset folder for required icons. 

  Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
