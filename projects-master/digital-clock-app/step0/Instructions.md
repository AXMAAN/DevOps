Hello there, welcome to the first step of the Digital clock app tutorial. In this project, we are going to build Clock app to show current date and time along with some additional data. We will be using background images and icons. You can find these images in the `public` and `assets` folder. We will be using `React`, `JS` and `CSS3` to build this project.

Go through the `README.md` file to get a better idea of the project. You can view the final design of the project in the `design` folder. It contains the screenshots of the final output in desktop and mobile viewports.

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Build a small app to show current date and time.
2. Show random quote at the top.
3. Add Greeting Message and Background Image according to current time.
4. Show current date, time, location and timezone.
5. Add bottom panel to show additional data.

Now that you have understood the basic requirements, hop on to the next step and start building the it!
