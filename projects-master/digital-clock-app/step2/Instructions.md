In this step the main goal is to build the `Clock` component, add static content to it and Style the component to show all the data properly.

## What will you do?

In this step you are tasked to create a new `Clock` component in components folder and import it and use inside `App` component.

1. Create the component with static data.

2. Import required svgs for day and night from assets folder.

3. Create a button to Show more details. Toggle it's state using `useState` hook.

4. Style and positions all the components except the bottom panel which we will build later.
