Now finally we just need to create a bottom panel we user should be able to toggle using toggle button we created in step 2.

## What will you do?

1. Add a `div` tag in `Clock` component and position it fixed to detach form normal page flow.

2. Set its `bottom` value to `-999px` to hide it on load.

3. Add a `active` class to it and set `bottom` property to `0` in it.

4. Toggle the active class on button click. You can also add a `transition` property to animate it.

5. Show the additional data related to current date according to design.

Finally you should have a working clock app widget with some additional data.

- What else
  - You can add a logic to fetch a random quote every hour.
  - Add sound effects according to current hour. Just like greeting message.
