Hello there, welcome to the first step of the Random Facts Generator tutorial. In this project, we are going to build a wwebpage which shows some random facts. You can find the look of box containing facts in the `assets` folder but you can also use your own imagination for styling. We will be using only `HTML5`, `CSS3`  and `JavaScript`to build this project. Go through the `README.md` file to get a better idea of the project.

:point_right: Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Create a random facts generator webpage.
2. Make sure that it should be highly responsive, especially in mobile view.
3. Use good font of your choice and choose good color combination.

Now that you have understood the basic requirements, hop on to the next step and start building it!
