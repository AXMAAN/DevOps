Hello there, welcome to the first step of the Password Generator project. In this project, we are going to build a password generator as per the provided designs. We will be using only `HTML5`, `CSS3` and `JavaScript` to build this project.

Go through the `README.md` file to get a better idea of the project. You can view the final design of the project in the `design` folder. It contains the screenshots of the final output in desktop and mobile viewports.

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Build a password generator that looks as close to the designs as possible.
2. Ensure that the application is responsive and occupy the whole width of the page across different viewports.

Now that you have understood the basic requirements, hop on to the next step and start building the it!
