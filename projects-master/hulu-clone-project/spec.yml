short-description: Build Hulu landing page clone project to test your HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.
long-description: |
  Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
  
  This project focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!
  
  You can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
  
  Your users should be able to:
  
  - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
  
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
  
  Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
