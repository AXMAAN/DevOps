### How to display the value contained by variable into JSX

For Example, we declare a variable X
```javascript
let X = "Hello"
```

Now the value of X is displayed into JSX by enclosing the variable into a set of curly brackets:
```jsx
<p>{X} World!!</p>
```

When the web page renders, the final output over the browser will look like this:
```
Hello World!!
```
