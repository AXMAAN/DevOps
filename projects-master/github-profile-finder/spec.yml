short-description: Build a custom github profile finder using github username. It shows users details with his/her repository.
long-description: |
    Your challenge is to build out a Github Profile Finder App and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

    This project focuses on your React and understanding of Redux. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

    Your users should be able to

    - View the github repository and profile using github username.

    - Download the starter code and go through the README.md file.

    The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project.

    Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
