Welcome to this guided project on the Pomodoro app! In this project, we are going to build a simple yet elegant Pomodoro timer app. The pomodoro system :tomato: is a time management system which makes it easy to get started and keeps you fresh and focused. The system is simple:

1. Pick a task
2. Work on it for 25 minutes (a pomodoro :tomato:)
3. Take a five minute break
4. Repeat! Every four pomodoros, take a longer 15 minute break

Our app is going to have the following features:

- It will keep track of the number of pomodoros and the time remaining for each pomodoro.
- It will keep track of breaks, a five minute break after each pomodoro or a 15 minute break after four pomodoros.

Now that you have understood how the system works, move on to the next step and
get started. Good luck!
