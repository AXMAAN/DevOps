Now that we have pomodoros, we need breaks. For now, we will add short breaks
only. Once a pomodoro is over, a 5 minute break will start, after which a new
pomodoro will start again. The start button should never be shown again. Also,
the heading at the top must change to indicate whether it is currently a break
or a pomodoro.

This should be quite easy, so I'm not giving you any pointers here. Good luck!
