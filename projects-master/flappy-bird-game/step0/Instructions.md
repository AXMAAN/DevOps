Hey there, welcome to the first step of the Flappy Bird game tutorial. In this project, we are going to build a Flappy Bird game with the all the basic functionality. We will be using only `HTML5`, `CSS3`, and `JavaScript` to build this project. This project assumes that you have a basic knowledge of the technologies and have worked on a few projects using these.

Go through the `README.md` file to get a better idea of the project. You can view the final game using the following [link](https://varunkt001.github.io/flappy-bird-starter/).

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Spawn randomly positioned obstacles that the players will have to dodge.
2. Enable the players to fly the bird using some keypresses.
3. Watch for collisions between the bird and the obstacles.
4. Keep track of the player's score based on how many obstacles he was able to avoid.

Now that you have understood the basic requirements, hop on to the next step and start building the project!

All the best ðŸš€
