long-description: |
  Your challenge is to build out a flappy bird game with all the basic features.

  This project focuses mainly on JavaScript. Some CSS is also needed, but it is fundamental, and any beginner can do it without issues.

  The game must include the following features:

  - Spawn randomly positioned obstacles that the players will have to dodge.

  - Enable the players to fly the bird using some keypresses.

  - Watch for collisions between the bird and the obstacles.

  - Keep track of the player's score based on how many obstacles he was able to avoid.

  The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project.

  All the best.
