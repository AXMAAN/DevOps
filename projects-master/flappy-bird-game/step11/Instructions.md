In this step, we aim to implement the logic for game over.

## What will you do?

Write the logic for the game over.

To keep things simple, every time the game is over, we will reload the window to reset the game.

```javascript
function gameOver() {
  window.location.reload();
}
```

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ we have finished our flappy bird game. We hope that you enjoyed building the project.
