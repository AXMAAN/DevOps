long-description: |
    Your challenge is to build out this Sign up page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

    This project focuses mostly on HTML and CSS using Tailwind CSS framework. 

    It will be good to use Tailwind CSS framework to complete this project.

    Your users should be able to:

    - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

    - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

    - Download the starter code and go through the README.md file.

    The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project.

    The Product Design is given in the "Product-Design" folder (You can refer to it).

    Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
