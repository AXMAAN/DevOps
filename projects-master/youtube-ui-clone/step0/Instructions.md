Hello there, welcome to the step zero of the YouTube UI Clone Project. In this project, we are going to build a youtube clone using nothing other than our own `HTML` and `CSS`.
(Don't sweat if you don't understand it now)

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Build a YouTube UI Clone
2. Make sure it is responsive to the screen size

Now that you have understood the basic requirements, we can start actually building the project.

For this step, we can just include the Material icons, and the font family we are going to use in the project.

So, start off by removing the contents of `<body>` tag in `index.html` file and clear out the contents of `style.css` as well.

Then include the material icons in the `index.html` by using:
```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet" />
```

You may place it under the line in which we have included the `style.css` file.

Now, in the `style.css` file place this line:
```
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300;400;700&display=swap');
```

What is this going to do? It will include the Roboto font family, which we are going to use in our project.

Hurray! This marks the end of step 0. Hop on to next step to continue.
