# Image Background Remover Python Script With U2Net
Remove Backgrounds From Images with u2net Trained model

I was surfing the internet searching for AI tools, and I stumbled upon an Image Background Remover service called Remove.Bg. But I was shocked with the pricing. 0.2$ / Image!

So I decided to take the challenge and build my own Image Background Remover without relying on any APIs or Third Parties.

After Searching for a couple of days, I found a great python project on GitHub, Called U2Net.

A Big Shootout and Thanks to the authors of this project!

I trued my best to make things as simple as possible, so even newbies, can use and run the python script I built.

I created a Short Video Showing The Script & How to use it, and I pointed to two special secrets that may help you build an online income stream with the help of this script. here is the video:
